PurchaseConfirmation
====================

WildStar addon which intercepts "unsafe" 1-click purchases, and injects a confirmation dialog.

Source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/kaporten/PurchaseConfirmation).

Released versions are published on [Curse](http://www.curse.com/ws-addons/WildStar/220154-purchaseconfirmation). Full addon description can be found on Curse as well.

Curse lists the addon license as "All Rights Reserved", but that's just because you _have_ to select a license on CurseForge, and I couldn't be bothered to read up on the different licenses. Consider this notice my express permission to copy/fork the addon in part or in whole, at any point in time, for any reason :)

I'd appreciate a notification if you do, though.
